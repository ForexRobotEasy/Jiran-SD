## How it Works

The Jiran SD Forex Software EA is designed to be used on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It utilizes neural networks to analyze market data and make predictions on future price movements. The EA checks if the current currency pair is supported and if the spread is within the required range for optimal trading. 

The initialization function (`OnInit()`) checks if the current currency pair is supported and if the spread is within the required range. If any of these conditions are not met, the initialization fails. It also sets the account leverage and initializes the neural networks.

The deinitialization function (`OnDeinit()`) is called when the EA is removed from the chart. It deinitializes the neural networks.

The tick function (`OnTick()`) is called on every tick. It checks if the current currency pair is supported and if the spread is within the required range. If these conditions are met, it analyzes the data using the neural networks and places a trade based on the analyzed data.

The EA also includes several helper functions:
- `IsSupportedCurrencyPair()` checks if the current currency pair is supported.
- `InitializeNeuralNetworks()` initializes the neural networks.
- `DeinitializeNeuralNetworks()` deinitializes the neural networks.
- `AnalyzeData()` analyzes data using the neural networks and returns a prediction value.
- `OpenBuyPosition()` opens a buy position.
- `OpenSellPosition()` opens a sell position.
